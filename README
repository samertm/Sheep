So, I haven't worked on this in a while. I'll get around to it, it's just that the codebase is kinda messy.
I've only tested this on Linux at the moment, but it should be able to compile on any Unix system with gcc. The version of gcc that I'm using is 4.5.2.
To compile it, you first need to install SDL. The command on debian-based linux systems (including ubuntu) is "sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev". There's probably some way to package SDL with this, but I haven't figured it out yet.
After you've compiled it, either double click "sheepgame" or run the command "./sheepgame" in the terminal. It's actually not much of a game yet hahaha, but I'm getting there.
